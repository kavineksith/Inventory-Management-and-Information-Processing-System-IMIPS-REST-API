## Security Features Implemented

### Authentication & Authorization

#### Multi-Layer Authentication
1. **JWT Tokens** - Signed with strong secret
2. **Session Tracking** - Database-backed sessions
3. **Token Validation** - Issuer and audience verification
4. **Session Verification** - Active session check on each request

- Admin, Manager, Staff roles
- Granular permissions per endpoint
- Hierarchical access control
- Audit trail for permission violations

#### Password Security
- Bcrypt hashing (12 rounds)
- Strong password requirements:
  - Minimum 8 characters
  - Uppercase and lowercase letters
  - Numbers and special characters
  - Common password blacklist
- Password change tracking
- Automatic session invalidation on password change

### Network Security

#### HTTPS Enforcement
- Automatic redirect from HTTP to HTTPS in production
- HSTS headers (1 year max-age)
- SSL/TLS 1.2+ only

#### Rate Limiting
- **Authentication endpoints**: 5 requests / 15 minutes
- **General API**: 100 requests / 15 minutes

- Custom error messages

#### CORS Configuration
- Whitelist-only origins
- No wildcards in production

- Preflight caching

### Data Protection

#### Encryption
- **At Rest**: AES-256-GCM for sensitive data
- **In Transit**: TLS 1.2+ enforced
- **Passwords**: Bcrypt with salt
- **Tokens**: Signed JWT with HMAC-SHA256

#### SQL Injection Prevention
- Parameterized queries exclusively
- No string concatenation
- Input validation on all endpoints
- ORM-style query builder

#### Input Validation
- Server-side validation with express-validator
- Type checking
- Length limits
- Format validation
- Sanitization

### Logging & Monitoring

#### Security Event Logging
- Failed login attempts
- Unauthorized access attempts
- Permission violations
- Suspicious activities
- Admin operations
- Password changes
- Session invalidations

#### Application Logging
- Request/response logging
- Error tracking
- Performance metrics
- Database query logging (non-production)
- Structured JSON logging

#### Audit Trail
- User activity tracking
- Last activity timestamps
- Session history
- Inventory movements
- Order modifications
- Email sent logs

### Security Headers

All responses include:
- `Strict-Transport-Security` - Force HTTPS
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` - Prevent MIME sniffing
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY` - Prevent clickjacking
- `X-XSS-Protection` - Browser XSS filter
- `Content-Security-Policy` - Restrict resource loading
- `Referrer-Policy` - Control referrer information
- `Permissions-Policy` - Feature permissions

## Security Testing Recommendations

### Automated Testing
```bash
# 1. Dependency vulnerability scan
npm audit

# 2. Static code analysis
npm run lint

# 3. Security header testing
curl -I https://api.yourdomain.com/api/health

# 4. SSL testing
nmap --script ssl-enum-ciphers -p 443 api.yourdomain.com
```

### Manual Testing
1. **Authentication bypass attempts**
2. **SQL injection testing** (should all fail)
3. **XSS injection attempts** (should be sanitized)
4. **CSRF attacks** (should be blocked)
5. **File upload exploits** (should be rejected)
6. **Rate limit verification** (should block after limit)
7. **Session management** (test timeout, invalidation)
8. **Authorization checks** (test role restrictions)

### Penetration Testing (Recommended)
- Professional security audit
- OWASP Top 10 testing
- Network vulnerability scan
- Social engineering assessment
